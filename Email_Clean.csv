Maintenance,Landscaping,"5130 Browns Pt Blvd Unit D - Landscaping  Dear Propvivo, 
Thank you for the recent letter regarding the dog poop remains in the way of the landscapers.
We will make sure in the future the remains are picked up immediately. 

You may not be aware of this, however, the landscaping crew has been quite reckless on the yards and damaged fences along with tearing up the sod. The small dog dropping I missed while they aren’t mowing my yard for a few weeks due to their damage was not as much of a concern to me at this time when they created a mud pit of the front yard.
I’ve included pictures of the damage they had done to our yard in particular.
Fortunately, the company I work for hires this firm to do some of our land development sites. I know the ownership group and got them to come over and make necessary repairs to the damage they made on my yard. 
Again, I’ll make sure poop is picked up quickly. In the big picture of this all, we simply got distracted to the big mess they created, as I hope you can understand. 
Best regards, 
Shanna Keene & Russ Sorkness    "

Governing Documents,Amendments,"Seaview Terrace: Consent to Fifth Amendment 2021 Customer Service sent you a copy.
REVIEW DOCUMENTS Customer Service
onlineaccounts@propvivo.com

Dear Homeowners,

The Seaview Terrace Townhouses Condominium Owners Association had a townhall meeting on July 15th, 2020. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss amending the governing documents as the current governing documents are outdated and need to be brought in compliance with the State of Washington RCW.

During this meeting an important item that was discussed was the ability to amend the governing document. The usual threshold for approval of Declaration amendment is 67%. However the current association original Declaration was written with a provision of 80%.

Before the association embark on the journey to amend the governing document, it is wise to update the provision so that the Declaration amendment can be done with 67%.

We are enclosing the Fifth amendment to Declaration and Covenants that will provide us the ability to amend the future Declaration with 67%.

We request your help to sign and return the “Consent Form”.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact propVIVO at (888) 392-3515 or email us at  services@propvivo.com.

Sincerely,

Seaview Terrace Townhouses Condominium Owners Association
Board of Directors

If we don't get a quorum, the 2021 Annual Meeting will need to be rescheduled, resulting in additional large expenses for the Association, and wasted time for the homeowners who did attend the meeting.

Maintenance,Repair,"Touraine - Sammamish WA - Pest Problem in 725 239th Ln SE, Sammamish WA Hi,

This is a follow up email to the conversation my wife Annie Kumar had with Victor earlier this afternoon regarding rat infestation in our townhome in the attic, crawl space and outside.

We are putting our townhome for sale this week and so did a home inspection and found rat activity. This has been an ongoing issue since last year but we never expected it to be inside the home. We had pest control come and service our home immediately. It was found that the attic has a hole through the neighbor's roof and  will need to be closed off to prevent future activity. We plan to complete repairs and close the openings in the attic on March, 19th 8am.

We would like to know how the HOA can help us with this issue and request to bear the expense of the repairs.  It was also recommended to have tree branches cut down near the house and especially the roof. The neighbor's backyard has some trees that are close to the house and have been notified of this issue.

Since we are putting our home for sale this week, there is an urgency to control and disclose this issue to the buyer, please kindly consider this as an escalation.

Please see both the home inspection and pest control inspection attached for your review.

You can reach us via email or (Annie) or (Kumar).

Thank you,
Kumar Somasundaram

Maintenance,General Repairs,"Interior Renovation at 19410 Meridian Pl W, Bothell, 98012 Hello Nitin,


Thanks for connecting with me over the phone and for your warm welcome to the Flibert Road Community!

My wife and I are in the process of closing the home at 19410 Meridian Pl W, Bothell. Our closing date is Friday (3/19) but we plan to make some interior renovations before finally moving in sometime mid April.

Per our discussion on phone, this interior renovation only includes replacing the old carpet, interior paint of walls and ceilings, replacing the flooring on first floor with Vinyl planks and replacing kitchen counter top. We are not making any changes to the structure (pillars, exterior paint etc.) but still wanted to share this with the board as an FYI.


Please let me know if you have any questions. I can be reached on forward to hearing from you so that I can confirm with the contractor to begin the above work on Saturday (3/20).



Thanks,

Nikhil

The Roof Shampoo® roof cleaning method uses safe, effective, eco-friendly roof cleaning products to clean those ugly roof stains and will not harm any landscaping around your home.

We also offer gutter cleaning, moss prevention, and bird blocking!

We are superior in the industry as others use the bleach cleaning method which:

1. Corrodes metal
2. Releases toxic chlorine gas
3. Permanently kills plants
4. Lightens the stain but does not remove it
5. Runs into the ocean killing marine life
6. Incurs a pollution fine from the city

We DO NOT use bleach. Nothing on our truck has the ability to kill any of your ground cover, bushes, plants, or grass.

We work sunrise to sunset Monday through Saturday and are standing by and ready to go.

Governing Documents,Amendments,"Completed: Seaview Terrace: Consent to Fifth Amendment 2021 document has been completed
VIEW COMPLETED DOCUMENTS Customer Service
onlineaccounts@propvivo.com

All parties have completed Seaview Terrace: Consent to Fifth Amendment 2021.

Dear Homeowners,

The Seaview Terrace Townhouses Condominium Owners Association had a townhall meeting on July 15th, 2020. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss amending the governing documents as the current governing documents are outdated and need to be brought in compliance with the State of Washington RCW.

During this meeting an important item that was discussed was the ability to amend the governing document. The usual threshold for approval of Declaration amendment is 67%. However the current association original Declaration was written with a provision of 80%.

Before the association embark on the journey to amend the governing document, it is wise to update the provision so that the Declaration amendment can be done with 67%.

We are enclosing the Fifth amendment to Declaration and Covenants that will provide us the ability to amend the future Declaration with 67%.

We request your help to sign and return the “Consent Form”.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact propVIVO at (888) 392-3515 or email us at  services@propvivo.com.

Sincerely,

Seaview Terrace Townhouses Condominium Owners Association
Board of Directors

Documents Request,Other,"Sammamish Shores query Hello,

I am working with the buyer in a pending purchase of Unit 11 in the Sammamish Shores Association.  As part of placing a flood policy for the unit we need to confirm which building the unit is located in.  Two of the buildings, Buildings A & E are not subject to a flood insurance requirement but we have been unable to verify the building letter for the building containing Unit 11.

It is possible that documents for the Association will include a map showing the building letters that apply.

Dear Homeowner,

We hope you are doing well and safe!

The 2021 Annual Meeting of Members of  Westwood Village Owners Association will be held on Monday, March 15th, 2021 from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. The meeting will be an online meeting. Please join the meeting via Microsoft Teams.

URL: agenda for the meeting is in the meeting letter enclosed with this announcement.

The Board would like to emphasize that your presence and your vote is extremely important, since the HOA requires the quorum of the Members present in person or by proxy, in order to have a valid vote.

A proxy is only necessary if you will not be attending the meeting, but we request you to send the proxy even if you are attending the meeting so that if you change your plan at the last moment, we will have your proxy as you vote. Please send your proxy to proxy@propvivo.com. If we don't get a quorum, we will have to reschedule the 2021 Annual Meeting to meet the requirements of governing documents, resulting in additional expenses for the Association in organizing the meeting.

If you are unable to attend the meeting, we have enclosed a proxy for your use. You can appoint any person who would attend the meeting and vote on your behalf, and mention his/her designation or you can appoint the President of the Board of Directors (default option).

We look forward to seeing you at the meeting on Monday, March 15th, 2021.

Governing Documents,Amendments,"Seaview Terrace: Consent to Fifth Amendment 2021 Customer Service sent you a copy.
REVIEW DOCUMENTS Customer Service
onlineaccounts@propvivo.com

Dear Homeowners,

The Seaview Terrace Townhouses Condominium Owners Association had a townhall meeting on July 15th, 2020. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss amending the governing documents as the current governing documents are outdated and need to be brought in compliance with the State of Washington RCW.

During this meeting an important item that was discussed was the ability to amend the governing document. The usual threshold for approval of Declaration amendment is 67%. However the current association original Declaration was written with a provision of 80%.

Before the association embark on the journey to amend the governing document, it is wise to update the provision so that the Declaration amendment can be done with 67%.

We are enclosing the Fifth amendment to Declaration and Covenants that will provide us the ability to amend the future Declaration with 67%.

We request your help to sign and return the “Consent Form”.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact propVIVO at (888) 392-3515 or email us at  services@propvivo.com.

Sincerely,

Seaview Terrace Townhouses Condominium Owners Association
Board of Directors

Approval,HOA Budget,"510300 Collection Fees Dear Nitin and Anna,

Please comment on the proposed budget line item 510300 Collection Fees.  2019 was projected to reach $8,637 yet the proposed budget for 2020 is $0.
Unless there is a reclassification of where this expense will go, or unless there is a great downturn in delinquencies, I question this proposal.  Your clarification will be appreciated.
Thank you.
Duane


    "
Approval,HOA Budget,"Re: 510300 Collection Fees Hi Duane,

I just responded to your previous email that should address this question. Since Legal Reimbursement offset the Collection Fees it is not budgeted int the proposed budget.

The collection activity has also reduced over the last 18 months as compared to number of files that used to be in collection since December 2017.

If you think its a risk not to budget this as some collection matter goes over the 12 months then it might be a good idea to budget the Collection Fees expense.

Regards,
Nitin
